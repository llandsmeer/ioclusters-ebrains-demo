# The Inferior Olive in Arbor (EBRAINS DEMO)

A biophysically and morphologically detailed model

[DEMO LINK](https://wiki.ebrains.eu/bin/view/Collabs/io-clusters/)

**Quick start: open Network.ipynb under </> Lab**

## What can I find here?

 * This Colaboratory describes a model of the Inferior Olivary Nucleus
 * The original repository can be found here: github.com/llandsmeer/iopublic
 * The github model requires a GPU and a lot of patience to run.
 * In the Lab, one can find the notebook describing the model, setup and a simple example of IO research
 * Here, all models have been simplified to the point of being able to run on a single CPU under 30 seconds
 * Enjoy!
